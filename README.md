# premier-league-analysis
## Questions I tackled in this project:
* What team commits the most fouls?
* Does the number of red cards a team receives have an effect on its probability of winning a game?
* You have just been hired as a data analyst for a local soccer team. The team has recently signed on some junior players and wants to give them as much experience as possible without losing games. If the head coach could be confident in the outcome of a game by halftime, they would be more likely to give the junior players time on the field.
* The coach has asked you whether you can predict the outcome of a game by the results at halftime and how confident you would be in the prediction.
* By looking at this, if you don't see any functions etc that you would normally use, can you let me know so I can learn to use them. If possible I'd like to know functions that you use a lot 
* The green comments are my explanations / answers
